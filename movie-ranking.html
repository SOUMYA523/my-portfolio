<h1>The Best movies according to Soumya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Bahubali</h3>
<p>both the parts of this movie hold so much depth. whether it be the story line or the garphics, the display of affection, valor, revenge all is potrayed very exquistely.</p>
<h3>Notiing hill</h3>
<p>very romatic and beautifull all in all. the acting of both stars is very emotional plus they got the talent to speak more than their dialogues.</p>
<h3>hometown cha cha cha</h3>
<p>this is  a korean web series, not a movie but it again it is very beautiful. it hold the power to immerse its viewers into its story and make them melt at various points in the episodes. one beautiful thing is that both characters potrayed two different qualities, one showed immense kindness and the ability to stay happy in small things in life whereas other character is shown more ambitious and more reluctunt to persue a respectable career. both overcome their past and their fears to finally have a happy ending to be together.</p>
